== Deploying a basic Camel K Java integration
// Start the title of a procedure module with a verb, such as Creating or Create. See also _Wording of headings_ in _The IBM Style Guide_.

This tutorial demonstrates how to run a simple Java integration in the cloud on OpenShift, apply configuration and routing, and run an integration as a Kubernetes CronJob.

.Prerequisites

* See the tutorial readme in GitHub: link:https://github.com/openshift-integration/camel-k-example-basic[].
* You must have cluster administrator access to an OpenShift 4.3 cluster to install Camel K. See xref:installing-camel-k-operatorhub[].
* You must have the `kamel` command installed. See xref:installing-camel-k-client-tool[].
* Visual Studio (VS) Code is optional but recommended for the best developer experience. See xref:setting-up-environment[].

.Procedure

. Clone the tutorial Git repository:
+ 
[source,bash]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:openshift-integration/camel-k-example-basic.git
----
. In the VS Code navigation tree, right-click the `readme.didact.md` file and select *Didact: Start Didact Tutorial from File*. For example: 
+
image::images/camel-k/camel-k-quickstart-didact.png[Starting the Camel K Quickstart tutorial]
+
This opens a new Didact tab in VS Code to display the tutorial instructions. 

. Follow the tutorial instructions and click the provided links to run the commands automatically. 
+
Alternatively, if you do not have VS Code installed with the Didact extension, you can manually enter the commands from link:https://github.com/openshift-integration/camel-k-example-basic[].
